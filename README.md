Certainly, I've updated the README with the version information and a mention of the public API used in your code. Here's the revised README:

# API Tests Readme

This README provides an overview of the Java code for conducting API tests using the RestAssured library. The code includes various test cases for interacting with a RESTful API. The purpose of this document is to describe the structure of the code, provide context for each test, and specify the library versions used.

## Introduction

The provided Java code is used to perform API testing on a RESTful API using the RestAssured library. The code is organized into test cases that interact with various API endpoints, make requests, and validate responses.

## Code Structure

The code consists of the following main components:

- Import statements: These import necessary classes and libraries for the tests.

- Initialization and Setup: The `initializeObjects` method is executed before running the tests, and it initializes necessary properties using `FrameworkProperties`.

- Test Cases: There are several test cases implemented, each with a specific purpose and focus.

## Library Versions

The code is configured to use the following library versions:

- Java Compiler Source and Target: Java 18

- JUnit Version: 4.12

- Maven Compiler Plugin Version: 3.3

- RestAssured Version: 4.3.2

- Gson Version: 2.8.5

- Jackson Databind Version (Test Scope): 2.10.3

Please ensure that you have the specified library versions or compatible versions installed and configured for your project. Make sure to check for the latest versions on the Maven Central Repository or the official websites of these libraries.

## Test Cases

### testGetUsers

- Description: This test sends a GET request to retrieve a list of users from the API.

### testGetUsers2

- Description: This test is similar to `testGetUsers` but additionally parses the response as JSON using the `GetUsersResponse` class and verifies the structure of the response.

### testGetResource

- Description: This test sends a GET request to retrieve a resource and verifies the response by comparing it with an expected `Resource` object.

### getUserByIdTest

- Description: This test sends a GET request to retrieve a user by ID and verifies the response by comparing it with an expected `User` object.

### registerUser

- Description: This test sends a POST request to register a new user using the provided email and password. The response is then parsed to retrieve the user ID and token.

Each test case includes a detailed description of its purpose and actions performed. You can modify and extend these test cases as needed for your specific API testing requirements.

Please ensure you have the necessary dependencies, libraries, and configuration set up to run these tests successfully. Additionally, make sure to replace any test data and constants with appropriate values for your specific API testing scenarios. The public API used in this code is "https://reqres.in/," so ensure that it is accessible for your API testing to work correctly.
